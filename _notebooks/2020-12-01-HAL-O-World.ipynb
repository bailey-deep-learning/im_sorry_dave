    "So today is a monumental day in the field of deep learning, [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology) by [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) has been recognised as a solution to the [“protein folding problem”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding) and marks the end of a challenge set over 50 years ago. This breakthrough demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world. So now is as good a time as any to really get involved and start learning to Deep Learn."

There are a couple of steps that are required to get setup to make the most of the work presented, and I thought that a good place to start a blog is with some notes on how to get setup."

    "\n",
    "Working as a Technical Animator in video games and having written Python code for nearly a decade now, I was aware of juypter notebooks, but I felt that as it was only useful for creating \"pretty comments\" inline with your code. Yes it would be cool to have an animated gif as part of your documentation but how useful are they in reality? It turns out that they are awesome! I am writing this very blog post using them right now and I am really impressed. The fastai team have created this entire blogging platform `fastpages` to help people get up and running quickly. Jeremy from fastai has also created a great talk about the power of notebooks and their platform `nbdev` here which is worth a watch. \n",

No more package dependency hell, especially when installing large packages for deep learning. Simply follow the link above and download the graphical installer for your OS.

    "Another fantastic facet of the course is that they don't encourage you to wade into the murky world of systems administration setting up packages, environments and GPU compliant kernels to get you up and running working with state-of-the-art deep learning models. They instead encourage you to look into using a Server Notebook, they reccommend either [Collab](https://course.fast.ai/start_colab), [Gradient](https://course.fast.ai/start_gradient) or [Sagemaker](https://course.fast.ai/start_sagemaker). I chose [Paperspace Gradient](https://console.paperspace.com/) and I am very happy with my choice."

    "By far the most frustrating part of the set up for the course has nothing to do with Python, the notebook server, GitHub or fast.ai. In Chapter 2 of the book, the course encourages you to set up a Microsoft Azure account to get an API key so you can use their Image Search conginitive service to pull training images from the web to train a classifier model. Unfortunately the documentation on the site and the forum isn't incredibly helpful, so I am logging it here incase anyone should find it useful, but mainly if I have to do this again on another account I can remeber how and where to find everything.\n",
